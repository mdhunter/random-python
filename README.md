# random-python
A collection of scripts exploring Python through addressing curious questions.


## Motivation
In an effort to become more familiar with Python (outside the mere reading
and troubleshooting of scripts), I wanted to write scripts that do something.
That is, I wanted to create scripts that address some curiosity of mine,
and not just write random things to test arbitrary language features.
Typically, the question is formed "how might I do X?". And, while what X is
may of dubious utility, the exploration of the process invariably leads to a
much better understanding of the language and its ecosystem. These scripts are
the result of that exploration.
